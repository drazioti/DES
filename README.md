# DES
This is an implementation of Simple Data Encryption Standard program for the cryptography course.
It also has a logger which prints to a log file the time of each event.

The  encryption is now being done by argument parsing.
e.g. -e -k 0001001100110100010101110111100110011011101111001101111111110001 -m 0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111 -p -l

where -e is encrypy, -k is key followed by it, same way the message -m, -p is print the info and -l is write a log file.

example:
key		0001001100110100010101110111100110011011101111001101111111110001
message		0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111
cyphertext	1000010111101000000100110101010000001111000010101011010000000101
